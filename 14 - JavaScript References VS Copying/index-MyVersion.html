    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //TEAM & PLAYERS IS JUST A REFERENCE (NOT A COPY) TO THE ORIGINAL ARRAY (JUST LIKE POINTER IN C)
    //team[3] = 'Lux';
    //console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //COPY ARRAY USING EMPTY SLICE
    console.clear();
    const team2 = players.slice(); //RETURNS THE ENTIRE ARRAY (UNTOUCHED if nothing passed)
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team2);


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); //FILL IN EMPTY ARRAY WITH OLD ARRAY
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'AAAAAAAH';
    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'YAAAAY';
    console.log(players, team5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 =  Object.assign({},person,{number:99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2, person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    //nested object on object.assign does not work
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
