# Adding Up Times with Reduce

A [Wes Bos ](http://wesbos.com/) project part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course.

## What I learned

* Collect an array of Strings containing formatted time (minutes, seconds) and calculate the total amount of hours, minutes and seconds.
  * **Map()** to obtain the array of  strings
  * **Split()** to separate minutes from seconds
  * **parseFloat()** to convert form string to number
  * **reduce()** to sum the total in seconds
  * **Division (/)** and **Modulus (%)** to divide the total amount of seconds into hours, minutes and seconds
